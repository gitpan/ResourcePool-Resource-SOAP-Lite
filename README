	Improved testing
	
		Made the timeout in the tests less restritive to avoid false failure in case the test is performad on a loaded machine (Bug #29200).
	


	2005-01-06
	Fixed CPAN bug #9391 (stringified hash key)
	
		ResourcePool did use a stringified object as key in a hash reference. 
		This has been replaced by using Tie::RefHash.
	


	2003-05-07
	Fixed "Bizarre copy of ARRAY in leave" bug (again)
	
	Applied a patch from Chad Redman which is basically the same 
	as the patch from Eric Parusel which was partitially applied to 1.0102.
	This time I applied the patch to the correct CVS branch *argl*.
	
	
	Minor corrections and improvements in documentation.
	


	2003-03-27
	New LoadBalancer policies FailBack and FailOver
	
		Two new LoadBalancer policies have been introduced: FailBack is a alias for FallBack,
	    and FailOver which acts like FailBack but does stay on the fall back node.
	
	
		Applied patch from Eric Parusel to fix a problem when debuging LoadBalancer.
	


	2003-03-14
	minor bugfix
	
		An obsolete dependency for the Storable module has been removed.
	


	2003-02-27
	Added a Command execution environment
	
		This release introduces a new way to use ResourcePool and
		LoadBalancer. It implements the Command design pattern as described
		in the GOF Design Patterns book. This release is a preview,
		the features are not yet fully implemented and might therefore not
		sufficient for you needs right now.
	


	2003-01-02
	Separated core from DBI and Net::LDAP bindings
	
		From this release on, the ResourcePool package will not contain
		resource bindings anymore. The previously included bindings for DBI 
		and Net::LDAP are available in the ResourcePool-Resource-DBI and 
		ResourcePool-Resource-Net-LDAP packages on CPAN.
	
	
		Applied patch from James G Smith which introduced the is_created
		method to ResourcePool::Singleton. This does not change the
		behavior of any ResourcePool module.
	


	2002-11-25
	Performance improvements
	
		The runtime overhead introduced by ResourcePool and LoadBalancer has been reduced. Depending on you configuration this release has up to 35% less overhead.
	
	
		Fixed a bug in LoadBalancer's documentation. The Weight parameter works only for the LeastUsage policy.
	
	
		A general code cleanup has been done to gain the performance benefits.
	
	
		Added tests for LoadBalancer.
	


	2002-10-07
	Improved usability of factories
	
		A refactoring of the Singleton behavior of ResourcePool::Factory makes it possible to implement nicer factories
	
	
		Adopted ResourcePool::Factory::Net::LDAP to have a more native interface.
	
	
		Fixed links within the POD documentation (was broken for some pod2html translators)
	
	
		Added documentation for Net::LDAP bindings which were lost in the previous release.
	


	2002-09-30
	Added documentation
	
		Added documentation: ResourcePool::BigPicture, ResourcePool::UML and ResourcePool::ExtensionGuide
	
	Changed Net::LDAP factory to accept the bind parameters in the
same way as Net::LDAP expects them.
	
	
		Added tests
	


	2002-08-30
	Major bugfix for Net::LDAP bindings
	
Fixed a major bug in Net::LDAP bindings which was introduced in
V0.9906. Every LDAP connection was believed to be broken when
handed back via free().
	



	2002-07-10
	Bugfix for DBI bindings when using RaiseError
	
wrapped DBI calls into eval{} blocks to make RaiseError aware.
	
	
It's possible to pass the options for ResourcePool and LoadBalancer
using a Hash reference.
	
	added tests



	2002-07-05
	Bugfix for DBI bindings when not using AutoCommit
	
A rollback() is performed on DBI sessions with AutoCommit disabled
when they are free()ed.
	
	
free() and fail() for ResourcePool and LoadBalancer return meaningful
values.
	
	added tests



	2002-06-04
	Major feature enhancements
	
Implemented the SleepOnFail option for ResourcePool and LoadBalancer.
	
	
Fixed typo in Net::LDAP bindings which caused incomplete error reporting
(thx to Sean Welsh)
	
	
Fixed many typo's in the documentation (thx to Florian Helmberger)
	
	
Greatly improved and extended the documentation.
