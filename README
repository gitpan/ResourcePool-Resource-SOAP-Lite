Copyright (c) 2003 by Markus Winand <mws@fatalmind.com>

See COPYRIGHT section in the ResourcePool::Resource::SOAP::Lite(3pm) manpage.

Recent Changes
--------------
  *  This release included a tiny Call command for SOAP::Lite. So you 
     can use the fail over algorithms of ResourcePool::LoadBalancer 
     for SOAP RPC calls. 

Installation
------------
    This modules requires ResourcePool to be pre installed.
    ResourcePool and this package are a pure perl implemented
    modules and should therefore run everywhere where perl is
    already installed.

    The well known procedure is:
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install 

Examples
--------
    Are included in the manpages which come with this distribution.
    To start with ResourcePool read the ResourcePool::BigPicture(3pm)
    manpage, to learn something about the SOAP::Lite bindings included
    in this package visit the ResourcePool::Factory::SOAP::Lite(3pm) manpage.
