Changelog for ResourcePool::Resource::SOAP::Lite

V1.0101 - 2003-05-07

  *  A bug which caused useless error messages when a problem with a 
     server happend has been fixed. The error message does now 
     include the proxy URL of the failed server. 

V1.0100 - 2003-02-27

  *  This release included a tiny Call command for SOAP::Lite. So you
